Scrape top headlines from a news website means to use an automated program (called a web scraper) to fetch the website's content and extract the main news titles (headlines) from it. 
Instead of manually visiting the website and copying headlines, a scraper does this automatically by:
1)Requesting the website's HTML (web page code) using a tool like requests in Python.
2)Parsing the HTML to find the specific elements that contain news headlines, usually HTML tags like <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, or elements with certain classes.
3)Extracting the headline text from those elements.
4)Saving these extracted headlines into a file like a .txt for easy access and analysis.
This process helps in collecting news data efficiently for uses like research, trend analysis, or building news aggregators without manually browsing the site.
For example, using Python with libraries like requests (to fetch the HTML) and BeautifulSoup (to parse and extract headlines) is a very common approach to news scraping.
"scrape top headlines from a news website" means automatically gathering the main news titles from that site by programmatically reading and processing the site's web pages.
